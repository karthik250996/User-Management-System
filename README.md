# User Management System
This is an app built using React to maintain user details. It allows the user to add, remove or edit a user and also filter for users based on **Name** and **EmailId**. It uses react-router for routing and redux to maintain state.

## Tools Used
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- React-router
- Redux 
- React-redux
- NodeJS - 8.11.1
- WebPack - 3.7.7

# Steps to run the app

- Install nvm for your OS
- Install Node (preferably using nvm to avoid permission issues)
```sh
nvm install 8.11.1
```
- To use the node version you just installed do:
```sh
nvm use 8.11.1
```
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the directory in which the app sits and run the following command which will install all the dependencies required to run the app
```sh
npm install
```
- Run the following script to start the server
```sh
webpack run dev-server
```
- **Webpack** running in your terminal will tell you where the app is being hosted. Access it in your browser and you are good to go!

## PS: You might run into a node-sass error if you're trying to run the app on linux, use **--unsafe-perm** to get past it. 

# Have Fun!! Cheers!
